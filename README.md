Python selenium and bs4 script to scrape https://medex.com.bd and https://www.shajgoj.com/(bs4 only) website filtering language specific & health related data. This was only made for educational purpose.

The files are very unstructured. The steps for successfully scraping the data are -

1.  Extract medicines page URL.(link_extract)
2.  Get the HTML page source (for bs4 script only)(html_extract)
3.  Extract the data (data_extract)

Future plane - make the readme great, make the code more stable - more clean
